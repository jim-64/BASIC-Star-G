# BASIC-Star-G
Space shooter game written in BASIC65 for the MEGA65

This game was written at the keyboard, typing in BASIC like the old days. I restricted myself to a single file and no cross-development work. If you list it, you can see the sprites were drawn in as data statements. One caveat, the music was programmed by Cryptoboy who may or may not have used cross development tools.
